# NYC-Airbnb-Data-Analysis
This data analysis project focuses on exploring and visualizing the NYC Airbnb dataset from the year 2019. The project utilizes Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to conduct an in-depth examination of the dataset, aiming to provide insights into the characteristics of Airbnb listings in New York City.
Project Goals:

**Data Loading and Exploration:** The project begins by importing the necessary libraries and loading the Airbnb dataset, followed by an initial exploration of the data. This step involves displaying the first few rows, checking the dataset's dimensions, and obtaining basic statistical details about the dataset using the describe function.

**Neighbourhood Group Distribution:** Visualizes the distribution of Airbnb listings across different neighbourhood groups in New York City using a countplot. The analysis reveals that Manhattan has the maximum number of Airbnb listings, providing valuable information about the geographical distribution of listings.

**Average Price Analysis:** Examines the average price of Airbnb listings by room type. This analysis identifies that entire rooms or apartments tend to be the most expensive, while private rooms and shared rooms are more affordable. The graph also highlights the preference of guests for different room types.

**Max Booking by Neighbourhood:** Determines the top ten neighbourhoods with the highest number of bookings and presents the results in a pie chart. This visualization provides an insight into the popularity of certain neighbourhoods for Airbnb bookings.

**Room Type Preference**: Analyzes the room type preferences of guests and presents the results in a bar chart. The analysis shows that people prefer entire home/apartment listings the most, providing an understanding of the accommodation choices of Airbnb guests in NYC.

**Number of Reviews by Neighbourhood Group:** Demonstrates the number of reviews received by each neighbourhood group using a bar chart. This analysis provides information about the popularity and guest engagement in different neighbourhoods of NYC.

**Conclusion**:
This project offers valuable insights into the NYC Airbnb market, including the popularity of neighbourhoods, room type preferences, average pricing, and guest engagement. It is a useful resource for anyone interested in understanding the dynamics of the NYC Airbnb market in 2019.
